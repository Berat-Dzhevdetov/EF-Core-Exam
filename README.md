# EF-Core-Exam
# ** The exam is wrote in EF Core 3.1 !!! **
#### This is my Entity Framework Core Exam from SoftUni. I didn't have much time so there might be some bad practice which I'm sorry for.
#### I wrote generic static class called ExamHelper which you can see, if you liked it or need it you can download it for free. The class doesn't have very good summary because I wrote it very late at night, but it helped a lot.
